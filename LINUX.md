# How to install JumpKingPlus on Linux

## Requirements

- You need to have a legit Jump King Steam copy on Windows

## Process

**Steps to do in Windows:**

1. Install Jump King and Jump King Plus to the latest version.
2. Save the whole Jump King folder somewhere that is accessible on Linux.

If you didn't change the games default folder, it should be: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\` or it can be found by right-clicking the game on steam, then `Manage > Browse Local Files`.

**Steps to do in Linux:**

1. Install Jump King on Linux if you haven't already.
2. Replace the Jump King folder with the Windows one that you saved before.
3. (Optional) Close and reopen Steam.

To verify that JumpKingPlus is installed, you should see the version in the top of the Main Menu in-game.

### Side note
You can put skins, collections and custom maps in Linux too. Check out the tutorials in the [youtube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/c/JumpKingPlus).
> This has only been tested on Manjaro Linux, but *should* work on every distro.
