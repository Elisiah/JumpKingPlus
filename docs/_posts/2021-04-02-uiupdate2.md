This website is going through an update to make it look better than before, since some stuff didn't quite work as well as I thought. The Workshop page got remade with a new sleek look, a new tag page has arrived onto the site, so you can browse more levels with the same tags! 
Two new pages will come soon... <!-- more -->the next UI updates will roll out in this post once published for the public!

### [`Tags`](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/tags/) new section!
