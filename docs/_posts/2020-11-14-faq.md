Common questions that you might have, here you will find a quick response! <!-- more -->

#### _JumpKing crashes after pressing a key. Fix?_
Delete your controller binds (they are .xml files, look the image below for an example) inside the `ControllerBinds` folder inside `Jump King\Content`.

#### _Can't uninstall JumpKingPlus..._
Reinstall JumpKing and try uninstall after downloading it again.

##### "Still not working :("
Send me a message through Jump King's Discord or Github and I'll try to help you through.

#### _Is it fine for speedrunning?_
![tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/tools.png)
JumpKingPlus has been [**approved**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/speedrun) on speedrun(dot)com for speedrunning. You will need to disable cheats (if you have them enabled, **cheats enabled runs will be not valid**). More details on the speedrun rules here: https://www.speedrun.com/jumpking

#### _Don't like the binds?_
>![Bind](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/bind.png)
 Sure, they are fully bindable on all devices (as long as you plug them in).
 The previous binds before installing JumpKingPlus **won't work** so please politely rebind your preferred controller.

 ---

#### _How do you toggle/untoggle the tools or "cheats"?_
Edit the `JumpKing.exe.config` file inside the Jump King folder; where it says `cheats="False"` change it to `cheats="True"` if you want to toggle "cheats".

---

#### _Can I customize JumpKingPlus?_
Yes, I left the source code on Github and you can easily recompile the `JumpKingPlus.dll` file if you would like.
