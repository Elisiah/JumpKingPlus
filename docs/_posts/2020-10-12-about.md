_An enhanced version of Jump King._ ✨

JumpKingPlus is an **enhancement** for Jump King with plentiful of small tweaks to make your hard climb to the babe even better! JumpKingPlus fully **supports** the community around the game <!--  more --> and has taken notes on the features/tweaks the game was missing and implemented it (such as a quick restart system, disabling the NPC speeches for full focus on those hard jumps and so on!). The full list of features and tweaks can be found below.

Small description for the features added.

<h3 id="egg">Easter eggs</h3>

With **JumpKingPlus**, there are included special unreleased lines that the merchants below will tell you once you reach that number!

|Story Mode|Seller|Quantity|Item|
|---|---|---|---|
|Main Babe|Merchant|69 |Gold Rings|
|New Babe+|NB+ Merchant|420|Silver|
|New Babe+|Snake|69|Ruby|
|GoTB|Shroom Guy|420|Mushrooms|
|GoTB|Mold Man|69|Ghost Fragments|

<h3 id="tools">Quote-on-quote cheats</h3>

One of these features has been the most requested and that is the Jump%; it shows on a scale from 1% to 100% the intensity of a jump (also known as "jump charge").
No fall and the teleport feature can be useful to warm-up in certain locations. The teleport feature is inspired over **DevilSquirrel's Jump King Manager**. Repo link below.

>Most of these are made for **training** and **tutorials** only. <br>Cheats can be enabled/disabled in the `JumpKing.exe.config` file and manually in-game. When these enabled, achievements are **not** achieveable.

The three tools as said are:
      
- Jump% (last jump percentage and current jump percentage)
- No fall
- Teleport feature (possible only in the story mode selected)
