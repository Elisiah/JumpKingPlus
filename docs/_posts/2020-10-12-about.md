_An enhanced version of Jump King._ ✨

JumpKingPlus is an **enhancement** for Jump King with plentiful of small tweaks to make your hard climb to the babe even better! JumpKingPlus fully **supports** the community around the game <!--  more --> and has taken notes on the features/tweaks the game was missing and implemented it (such as a quick restart system, disabling the NPC speeches for full focus on those hard jumps and so on!). The full list of features and tweaks can be found below.

## In-depth features
Small description for the features added.

### Discord Rich Presence
The first feature made onto JumpKingPlus has been the **Discord** integration using the Discord Rich Presence Client (RPC). 
>This has been a feature on it's own until now, JumpKingRPC won't get anymore big updates unless from this specific mod. If you are only interested about the Discord RPC mod, click [**here**](https://www.github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingRPC).

This tool can let you choose over three possible presets:

![Preset2](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/blob/master/docs/images/RichPresence2.gif)
![Preset3](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/blob/master/docs/images/RichPresence3.gif)


### Quick Restart
Very requested feature that speeds the time on restarting a new attempt. Below under **Hot keys** is the key for toggling the quick restart. The quick restart is about two times faster than `Save & Exit` and making a new attempt.


### Hot keys
Jump King on it's own it doesn't have complex keys - it's just left, right and space. But this minimalistic or simplistic choice makes cluttered and slow browsing the menus.
With this mod you can:
- Toggle <img class="icon" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-assets/726077029195448430/735954342825427134.png" height="15" /> **Snake Ring** by pressing `O`.
- Toggle <img class="icon" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-assets/726077029195448430/735947335305265202.png" height="15" /> **Giant Boots** by pressing `P`.
- Call the **Quick Restart** option by pressing `Q`.

Hotkeys in action.

#### _Don't like the keys?_
![Bind](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/blob/master/docs/images/bind.png)

Sure, they are fully bindable on all devices (as long as you plug them in).


### Menu overhaul
The menu has been reorganized to fit the JumpKingPlus features. You can see below a couple images of the new menu, the new `Stats display` and the inventory in the Main Menu.

![Pause](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/blob/master/docs/images/pause.png)

The importance order of **Snake Ring** and **Giant Boots** can be seen inside the inventory in menu or in-game (obviously) in the image below.

<h3 id="egg">Easter eggs</h3>

With **JumpKingPlus**, there are included special unreleased lines that the merchants below will tell you once you reach that number of items! Have fun finding all of them!

|Story Mode|Seller|Quantity|Item|
|---|---|---|---|
|Main Babe|Merchant|69 |Gold Rings|
|New Babe+|NB+ Merchant|420|Silver|
|New Babe+|Snake|69|Ruby|
|GoTB|Shroom Guy|420|Mushrooms|
|GoTB|Mold Man|69|Ghost Fragments|


<h3 id="tools">Quote-on-quote cheats</h3>

One of these features has been the most requested and that is the Jump%; it shows on a scale from 1% to 100% the intensity of a jump (also known as "jump charge").
No fall and the teleport feature can be useful to warm-up in certain locations. The teleport feature is inspired over **DevilSquirrel's Jump King Manager**. Repo link below.

>Most of these are made for **training** and **tutorials** only. <br>Cheats can be enabled/disabled in the `JumpKing.exe.config` file and manually in-game. When these enabled, achievements are **not** achieveable.

The three tools as said are:
      
- Jump% (last jump percentage and current jump percentage)
- No fall
- Teleport feature (possible only in the story mode selected)
